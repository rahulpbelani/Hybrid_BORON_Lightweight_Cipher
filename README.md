# Hybrid_BORON_Lightweight_Cipher
• Proposed a hybrid BORON cipher by replacing its original key schedule with those from PRESENT and RECTANGLE  using Verilog HDL.  • Integrating the PRESENT key schedule reduces area by 20.7%, and power consumption by 8.3%, while integrating  the RECTANGLE key schedule reduces area by 10.5% and power consumption by 3.2%.
